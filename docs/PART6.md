# Create missions for your drone

You can create subflows in Node-RED.  A subflow acts like a function in other programming languages.  You can capture an existing flow, or part of a flow, into a subflow or create a subflow from scratch.  The subflows appear in the palette and look like any other nodes in the palette.  You can then drag the subflow nodes onto the palette to run the flow within the subflow.

## Task

Import the [part6 starter flow](/flows/starter/part6_starter.json), which provides you will all the subflow nodes as shown in the video.  You should create a patrol mission for your drone, which comprises of the following tasks:

- Take off
- Descend 1.5 meters
- Rotate 360ยบ clockwise
- Complete a square by moving forward 50cm, then rotating 90ยบ and repeating 4 times
- Land

Be sure to add sufficient delays into your solution to allow the drone to complete all the moves.  Add a new group to the dashboard and then create a button to allow you to start the mission from the dashboard.

You can import a [sample solution](/flows/solutions/part6_solution.json) if you need help or want to compare your solution with a sample solution.
